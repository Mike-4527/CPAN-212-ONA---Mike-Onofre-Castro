A short explanation of Asynchronous programming:
- Asynchronous programming is a non-blocking input/output protocol and it means that Asynchronous can take multiple requests at once.
  If the Asynchronous takes longer to finish the task, it moves to another task before it finish's on final task, therefore, creating responses
  when finished.
  
  
A short Explanation of ECMAScript usage:
- A ECMAScript is a standard JavaScript feature that is similar to original JavaScript syntaxes and the usage of ECMAScript is used most since
  it was originated in May 1995 and the latest version is ES6, which was released in June 2015. It is most commonly used for education, project, business,
  and coding, making a valuble tool. These features of ECMAScript are used in "modern js ECMAScript" PowerPoint located in Learning Materials of Module 2.
  

  A Explanation of Microservice Architecture Component:
  - A Microservice is a service that it is a Node.js framework to support the node.js application and the ability to support the launch of application without major errors. The two additional services that may exist in a larger system are Monolithic and ECMAscript which important to aid the development of Node.js application and it is the important services to support the application project if it consists Node.js. One scability benefit of Microservices is a structure of what the project looks like, what are requirements to ensure a successful launch of a application, and why is it good to work with developers.
